*
* @brief Physical switch abstraction and API
*
* The physical switch is the abstraction that contains
* the state of a forwarding device (e.g. a physical switch, 
* or a server).
*
* The physical switch stores fundamentally information about:
*
*    - System ports(net interfaces): the ports availableon the system. This 
*      interfaces may be physical ports, or virtual,
*      depending on the system. The semantic of a 
*      virtual port is strictly bound to the system
*      in which is running (take a look at switch_port.h
*      for more details).
*
*      The discovery of the system ports is up to the library user. It
*      must be done during initialization and before ANY logical switch 
*      has been added to the physical switch.
*
*    - Logical switches instances: a logical switch instance is a runnable
*      instance of a switch that uses one or more of the ports available
*      in the phyisical system. In other words, a logical switch is what
*      OF protocol defines as "datapath", but only concerning forwarding
*      (excluding the OF endpoint).
*
*       Logical switches are of type of_switch, and may be created using
*       the version specific init/destroy functions provided by the library.
*       (e.g. of1x_init_switch). Immediately after, they must be added to
*       the physical switch. Note that instances not added to the physical
*       switch are completely meaningless(*).
*
*       Once added the ports can be attached to the logical switch, and 
*       eventually, in the case of the software switches, start to process
*       packets using the call of_process_packet_pipeline.
*
*
* A typical usage of the library in the case of a software switch (that is, it uses
* rofl-pipeline to process packets) would be:
*
* @code
*
* physical_switch_init(); //This must be always the first
* 
* //Here the user MUST fill in the available ports
* //E.g. interfaces
*
* for i in num of interfaces:
*    switch_port_t* port = switch_port_init("eth0", true, PORT_TYPE_PHYSICAL, LOGICAL_PORT_STATE_FREE);
*    //Add it to the physical switch
*    physical_switch_add_port(port);
*
* //Now we create one or more Logical switch instances
* dpid = 0x100;
* of_switch = of1x_init_switch(dpid,...);
*
* //Note from this point on if any port is attached
* //The switch will start to process packets so 
* //processing threads may be launched depending on the
* //system.
*
* //Also note I/O system for receiving and sending packets
* //must be ready at least immediately after the attachment 
*
* //Now we attach a port
* port = physical_switch_get_port("eth0");
* sw = physical_switch_get_logical_switch_by_dpid(dpid);
* physical_switch_attach_port_to_logical_switch(port, sw, &port_num);
*
* //Switch should receive packets and process them
*
* @endcode
*
