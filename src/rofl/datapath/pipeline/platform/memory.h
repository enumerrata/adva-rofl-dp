/**
* @file memory.h
* @author Marc Sune<marc.sune (at) bisdn.de>, Tobias Jungel<tobias.jungel (at) bisdn.de>  
*
* @brief Defines the memory management interface used by the library. 
* The user of the library MUST provide an implementation for his/her platform.
*
* The memory management API is the set of calls used by library
* to perform dynamic memory allocation/deallocation, as well as
* other memory operations (like copy or move).
*
* The user MUST provide an implementation for his/her particular
* platform. 
*
* The calls sufixed with "_shared" are meant to allocate memory that
* is shared between all the threads, hardware threads, cores or in general
* any system, that may perform operations (flow entry insertions, packet
* pipeline transvering...) over the SAME logical switch.
*
* In a typical POSIX/libc system this would probably be directly malloc/free
* and the respective other calls, except maybe for the "_shared_" calls 
* (depending on the threading/process used). E.g. in a single process application
* "_shared" and non-shared mallocs/free maps to the same LIBC malloc/free
*
*
