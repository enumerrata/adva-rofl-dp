* @brief Defines the locking interface used by the library. 
* The user of the library MUST provide an implementation for his/her platform.
*
* The locking API is the set of calls used by library
* to perform mutual exclusion operations. It is pretty much a standard
* POSIX-like interface, except for minor details. 
*
* The user MUST provide an implementation for his/her particular
* platform. 
*
* In a typical POSIX/libc system this would probably be mapped straight
* forward to pthread_mutex and pthread_rwlock calls.
